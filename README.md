### Introduction
Car price prediction is a crucial task in the automotive industry, helping both buyers and sellers make informed decisions. This project utilizes a Linear Regression model to predict car prices based on a given set of features.

### Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from Kaggle and includes features such as:

Car_Name
Year
Selling_Price
Present_Price
Kms_Driven
Fuel_Type
Seller_Type
Transmission
Owner
You can download the dataset from Kaggle. The dataset file should be named car_data.csv 
### Model Training
The model training script (train.py) reads the dataset, preprocesses the data, and trains a Linear Regression model.

### Evaluation
The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics. These metrics provide insights into the performance and accuracy of the model.

### Results
After training, the model achieves an R-squared score of approximately 0.76, indicating a good fit to the data. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is 6.49, demonstrating the average squared difference between the predicted and actual car prices.
